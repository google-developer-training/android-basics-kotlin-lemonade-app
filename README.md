YAYYYY IT WORKED AFTER 3 ATTEMPTS which equivalents to almost 8 hours.... 

The most difficult part wsaa the clicklemonimage function because I googled my way through BUT my solution actually worked, though what I got from it was a reminder that order matters when it comes to executing commands

The setviewelements function was fun to write because I knew it used a when-function and by calling the string-ids, only I figured how to use it before I found that there was a tutorial that came with it LOL 

Modifying the views and constraints was not an issue at all, I almost forgot I did them
